Tetris program Guideline:

1.) Create the panels for game //abeers 5/16
2.) Specify panels for individual tasks //abeers 5/16
3.) Create and understand how gameboard panel will function //abeers 5/17
4.) Address all panels adding primitive text and buttons (to start and end a game, labels on all panels) //abeers 5/17
5.) Brainstorm about what it means to start a tetris game
6.) Create a Piece.java where we can put polymorphism to use (all pieces can spin, be dropped and be created)
7.) Give pieces colors and numbers
8.) Create pieces and place them at the top of the array of jPanels
9.) Somehow use the system clock to move the piece down after a certain amount of time
10.) Think about what it means to rotate a piece
11.) Create the code for rotations
12.) Apply Keyboard keys for rotations.
13.) TBD
